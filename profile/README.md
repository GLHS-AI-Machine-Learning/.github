Welcome to the official GitHub account for the GLHS AI & Machine Learning club!

For learning resources for Python and machine learning, please see our [Learning-Resources repository](https://github.com/GLHS-AI-Machine-Learning/Learning-Resources).

We are also currently working on a book recommendation project to help students and teachers at our school find books in our school media center based on their interests. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/GLHS-AI-Machine-Learning/Book-Recommendation).
